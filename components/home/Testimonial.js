Prior to the event, we felt it would be difficult for both teams to make one decision because we were two different communities managed by members of different age groups, different experiences, but the Code8 team was brilliant in unity, teamwork and hard work.  Our whole team is very grateful to Code8 as they have worked not only for the event, but they also give a lot of talks and advice to our team. In the end, I would like to say that If we got another chance to collaborate with the Team, we will be more than happy to do so."

They have also previously conducted hackathons and events on blockchain development which were really awesome. I am happy to be part of Code8 community. Wishing more growth to code8 and to learn more from the community."

        description: `Hello everyone, I'm Vikas Rai. Recently I attended TezIndia Blockchain Bootcamp 1.0. The Bootcamp was amazing. I didn't have any previous knowledge about Web 3.0. So this Bootcamp was very helpful to get to know about Web 3.0 and also get familiarized with Tezos Blockchain.

        The mentor was very knowledgeable and explained everything nicely.
        It was a one-week-long Bootcamp and after the end of Bootcamp, we also have to make the projects based on Tezos Blockchain.
        
        So, regarding that, I planned to build the "NFT Domain Marketplace" (Where people can buy web3 domain names).
        
        I got stuck at various points while building projects but thanks to the mentors and members of the Bootcamp they helped a lot in clearing our doubts and also suggesting the solution to our problem.
        
        In the end, I would like to say that the overall experience of this Bootcamp is so amazing and I wish they organize these kinds of Bootcamp again.
